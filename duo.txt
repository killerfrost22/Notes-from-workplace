Please ignore the previous email about duo adding a new device. It won't work for you since you do not have access to your old device. Please contact the IT Service Desk at 301.405.1500 or itsupport@umd.edu for assistance. 
Since He doesnt have the old device ready therefore we cannnot ask him to use the old device here to do the MFA thing
