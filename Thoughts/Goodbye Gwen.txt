Hi Gwen, it's being great working with you! 

You are a very good teacher. Great at explaining technical stuffs! 
I joined EIT helpdesk last year, and I learn things slowly and you are always there to help me out!
I remember I had trouble doing the comsol installation recently instead of just give me answer when I ask you question
you teach me how to figure out the proper solution using the ask article 


I think I am gonna miss you. 

I am so grateful that everyone at the helpdesk are wonderful people.

Goodbye and Best of luck in your new adventure.
