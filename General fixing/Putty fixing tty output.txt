In general, Xming will be used in conjunction with PuTTy to display a server that is connected via SSH on the host machine; X11 forwarding must be enabled in your PuTTy session in order to use Xming.  To enable X11 forwarding, perform the following:

1. On the main PuTTy interface, navigate to  'Connection'

2. Navigate to 'SSH'

3. Navigate to 'X11', and check the box next to 'Enable X11 Forwarding'
