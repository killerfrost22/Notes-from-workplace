Fix zoom recording voice too low
I found changing the volume mixer will change my zoom recording voice. Hopefully, this will solve your issue.
Adjust Volume via the Windows Volume Mixer
If you’re unable to adjust the volume in the Zoom meeting client, then you can always use the Windows volume mixer instead.

Step 1: Right click the speaker icon at the bottom right of your computer’s task bar and select Open Volume Mixer

Step 2: Find Zoom in the Volume Mixer and use the slider to lower the volume

Note: Sometimes 2 Zoom options appear in the volume mixer. Try to turn down (or up) the one with a “bobbing” green bar.

Please let us know if this doesn't work for you.
