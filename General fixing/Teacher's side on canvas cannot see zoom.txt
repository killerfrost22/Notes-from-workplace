Schedule Zoom meetings in ELMS-Canvas for instructors, TAs and GAs
Individuals with an instructor, co-instructor, graduate assistant or teaching assistant (TA) role can set up Zoom meeting rooms in ELMS-Canvas. To set up Zoom Meetings in ELMS-Canvas, your default email identified in user account settings MUST be your university email (that is, directoryid@umd.edu). Using any other email will generate an error code.

To check, click on the Account icon in the ELMS-Canvas global navigation, then click on the Settings link.  Note the email address(es) listed under Ways to Contact.  Your university email address must be identified with a favorited star.  If it is not, click on the Edit Settings button and select your university email in the default email field.
