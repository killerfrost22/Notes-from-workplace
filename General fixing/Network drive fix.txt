An interesting case on connecting to a k drive 

Used pulse & cisco anyconnect but none worked
Worked with the Lexi on the issue and investigating the drive path is correct

But given an error unavailable to connect 
I suspect the vpn might not working in her case now

Lexi added her to the eng group on cisco

Restarted and things magically fixed
