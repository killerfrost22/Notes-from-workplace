COMSOL INSTALLATION 

Figure out which license is appropriate for the installation.
Abshire and Albertus have their own group licenses. This may be appropriate for most of their installations but they are not limited to this.
There is a site FNL for research. This is primarily what you will focus on using.
Go to the software folder for Comsol.
Note that various versions and license files are available. 
Find the version requested and the license file for the group that the requester is a part of. This may even be simply the site license.
It is easy to mount the ISO in Windows from the share to the computer you're working on if you're doing a Tier 3 installation.
Get the appropriate installation media connected and begin the installation process. 
If you are loaning the software to someone, be sure the directions and license file are on the media.
Start the installer.
Start a new Comsol installation.
Accept the agreement.
License format: License file.
Point the installer at the group or site license file.
"Check" to make sure the license is found. You should see the license number and a list of modules.

DO NOT INSTALL THE LICENSE MANAGER - This is only needed on the license server itself and may confuse people.

Feel free to look through these with the customers or use your best judgment.
